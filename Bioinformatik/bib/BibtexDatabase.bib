	abstract = {The {BLAST} programs are widely used tools for searching protein and {DNA} databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting {Position-Specific} Iterated {BLAST} {(PSI-BLAST)} program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST,} but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI-BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive review of large and highly diverse superfamily of nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins by providing a global picture about their evolutionary history, sequence-structure diversity and fulfilled functional roles. Using top-of-the-line homology detection method combined with transitive searches and fold recognition, we revised the realm of these superfamily in numerous databases of catalogued protein families and structures, and identified 10 new families of nucleotidyltransferase fold. These families include hundreds of previously uncharacterized and various poorly annotated proteins such as {Fukutin/LICD,} {NFAT,} {FAM46,} Mab-21 and {NRAP.} Some of these proteins seem to play novel important roles, not observed before for this superfamily, such as regulation of gene expression or choline incorporation into cell membrane. Importantly, within newly detected families we identified 25 novel superfamily members in human genome. Among these newly assigned members are proteins known to be involved in congenital muscular dystrophy, neurological diseases and retinal pigmentosa what sheds some new light on the molecular background of these genetic disorders. Twelve of new human nucleotidyltransferase fold proteins belong to Mab-21 family known to be involved in organogenesis and development. The determination of specific biological functions of these newly detected proteins remains a challenging task.},

Recent crystal structures, plus three decades of enzymology, have revealed the elegant mechanisms by which {CCA-adding} enzymes achieve their substrate specificity in a nucleic acid template independent fashion. The class I {CCA-adding} enzyme employs both an arginine sidechain and backbone phosphates of the bound {tRNA} to recognize incoming nucleotides. It switches from C to A addition through changes in the size and shape of the nucleotide-binding pocket, which is progressively altered by the elongating 3' terminus of the {tRNA.} By contrast, the class {II} {CCA-adding} enzyme uses only amino acid sidechains, which form a protein template for incoming nucleotide selection.},

As expected, the catalytic domain of {poly(A)} polymerase shares substantial structural homology with other nucleotidyl transferases such as {DNA} polymerase beta and kanamycin transferase. The C-terminal domain unexpectedly folds into a compact domain reminiscent of the {RNA-recognition} motif fold. The three invariant aspartates of the catalytic triad ligate two of the three active site metals. One of these metals also contacts the adenine ring. Furthermore, conserved, catalytically important residues contact the nucleotide.

The geometry of the catalytic carboxylates and the relative positions of {CTP} and {ATP} to a single catalytic site are well conserved in both classes of {CCA-adding} enzymes, whereas the overall architectures, except for the catalytic core, of the class I and class {II} {CCA-adding} enzymes are fundamentally different. Furthermore, the recognition mechanisms of substrate nucleotides and {tRNA} molecules are distinct between these two classes, suggesting that the catalytic domains of class I and class {II} enzymes share a common origin, and distinct substrate recognition domains have been appended to form the two presently divergent classes.},

The majority of methane in nature is derived from acetate. Here we report the complete genome sequence of an acetate-utilizing methanogen, Methanosarcina acetivorans {C2A.} Methanosarcineae are the most metabolically diverse methanogens, thrive in a broad range of environments, and are unique among the Archaea in forming complex multicellular structures. This diversity is reflected in the genome of M. acetivorans. At 5,751,492 base pairs it is by far the largest known archaeal genome. The 4524 open reading frames code for a strikingly wide and unanticipated variety of metabolic and cellular capabilities. The presence of novel methyltransferases indicates the likelihood of undiscovered natural energy sources for methanogenesis, whereas the presence of single-subunit carbon monoxide dehydrogenases raises the possibility of nonmethanogenic growth. Although motility has not been observed in any Methanosarcineae, a flagellin gene cluster and two complete chemotaxis gene clusters were identified. The availability of genetic methods, coupled with its physiological and metabolic diversity, makes M. acetivorans a powerful model organism for the study of archaeal biology. {[Sequence,} data, annotations and analyses are available at http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/.]},

Characterization of an archaeal {CCA-adding} enzyme provides formal proof that the {CCA-adding} activity is present in all three contemporary kingdoms. Antibodies raised against recombinant, expressed Sulfolobus {CCA-adding} enzyme reacted specifically with the {48-kDa} protein and fully depleted all {CCA-adding} activity from S. shibatae crude extract. Thus, the cloned cca gene encodes the only {CCA-adding} activity in S. shibatae. Remarkably, the archaeal {CCA-adding} enzyme exhibits no strong homology to either the eubacterial or eukaryotic {CCA-adding} enzymes. Nonetheless, it does possess the active site signature {G[SG][LIVMFY]xR[GQ]x5,6D[LIVM][CLIVMFY]3-5} of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily identified by Holm and Sander (1995, Trends Biochem Sci 20:345-347) and sequence comparisons show that all known {CCA-adding} enzymes and {poly(A)} polymerases are contained within this superfamily. Moreover, we propose that the superfamily can now be divided into two (and possibly three) subfamilies: class I, which contains the archaeal {CCA-adding} enzyme, eukaryotic {poly(A)} polymerases, and {DNA} polymerase beta; class {II,} which contains eubacterial and eukaryotic {CCA-adding} enzymes, and eubacterial {poly(A)} polymerases; and possibly a third class containing eubacterial polynucleotide phosphorylases.

This homology extends as far as cca: {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferase and streptomycin adenylyltransferase, an antibiotic resistance factor.},

Using domain substitution experiments, we show that these enzymes follow a modular concept: exchange of N- and C-terminal regions leads to chimeric enzymes with unexpected activities, indicating that {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferase carries an "anchor domain" in the C-terminal section that restricts polymerization to three nucleotides. A 27 amino acid region was identified that determines whether {poly(A)} or {CCA} is synthesized by the enzyme chimeras. Sequence alignments suggest that the catalytic cores of both enzymes carry identical components involved in nucleotide recognition and incorporation. This seems to be the prerequisite for the observed reprogramming of the catalytic center of {PAP} to incorporate a sequence of defined length and composition instead of long stretches of A residues.},

Among those, {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferases show remarkable and unique features. These enzymes add the nucleotide triplet {C-C-A} to the 3'-end of {tRNAs} at an astonishing fidelity and are described as {"CCA-adding} enzymes". During this incorporation of exactly three nucleotides, the enzymes have to switch from {CTP} to {ATP} specificity. How these tasks are fulfilled by rather simple and small enzymes without the help of a nucleic acid template is a fascinating research area.

	abstract = {{CCA-adding} enzymes are specialized polymerases that add a specific sequence {(C-C-A)} to {tRNA} 3' ends without requiring a nucleic acid template. In some organisms, {CCA} synthesis is accomplished by the collaboration of evolutionary closely related enzymes with partial activities {(CC} and A addition). These enzymes carry all known motifs of the catalytic core found in {CCA-adding} enzymes. Therefore, it is a mystery why these polymerases are restricted in their activity and do not synthesize a complete {CCA} terminus. Here, a region located outside of the conserved motifs was identified that is missing in {CC-adding} enzymes. When recombinantly introduced from a {CCA-adding} enzyme, the region restores full {CCA-adding} activity in the resulting chimera. Correspondingly, deleting the region in a {CCA-adding} enzyme abolishes the A-incorporating activity, also leading to {CC} addition. The presence of the deletion was used to predict the {CC-adding} activity of putative bacterial {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferases. Indeed, two such enzymes were experimentally identified as {CC-adding} enzymes, indicating that the existence of the deletion is a hallmark for this activity. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of identified and putative {CC-adding} enzymes indicates that this type of {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferases emerged several times during evolution. Obviously, these enzymes descend from {CCA-adding} enzymes, where the occurrence of the deletion led to the restricted activity of {CC} addition. A-adding enzymes, however, seem to represent a monophyletic group that might also be ancestral to {CCA-adding} enzymes. Yet, experimental data indicate that it is possible that A-adding activities also evolved from {CCA-adding} enzymes by the occurrence of individual point mutations.},

Most importantly, we found that mutations in helix J can affect the specificity of the nucleotide binding site some 20 A away, suggesting that the specificity of both class I and {II} enzymes may be dictated by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds involving the protein, incoming nucleotide, and 3' end of the {tRNA.} Collaboration between {RNA} and protein in the form of a ribonucleoprotein template may help to explain the evolutionary diversity of the nucleotidyltransferase family.},

The genome of M. barkeri is distinguished by having an organization that is well conserved with respect to the other Methanosarcina spp. in the region proximal to the origin of replication, with interspecies gene similarities as high as 95\%. However, it is disordered and marked by increased transposase frequency and decreased gene synteny and gene density in the distal semigenome. Of the 3,680 open reading frames {(ORFs)} in M. barkeri, 746 had homologs with better than 80\% identity to both M. acetivorans and M. mazei, while 128 nonhypothetical {ORFs} were unique (nonorthologous) among these species, including a complete formate dehydrogenase operon, genes required for N-acetylmuramic acid synthesis, a 14-gene gas vesicle cluster, and a bacterial-like P450-specific ferredoxin reductase cluster not previously observed or characterized for this genus. A cryptic 36-kbp plasmid sequence that contains an orc1 gene flanked by a presumptive origin of replication consisting of 38 tandem repeats of a 143-nucleotide motif was detected in M. barkeri. Three-way comparison of these genomes reveals differing mechanisms for the accrual of changes. Elongation of the relatively large M. acetivorans genome is the result of uniformly distributed multiple gene scale insertions and duplications, while the M. barkeri genome is characterized by localized inversions associated with the loss of gene content. In contrast, the short M. mazei genome most closely approximates the putative ancestral organizational state of these species.},

	abstract = {Transfer {RNA} nucleotidyltransferases {(CCA-adding} enzymes) are responsible for the maturation or repair of the functional 3' end of {tRNAs} by means of the addition of the essential nucleotides {CCA.} However, it is unclear how {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferases polymerize {CCA} onto the 3' terminus of immature {tRNAs} without using a nucleic acid template. Here we describe the crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus {tRNA} nucleotidyltransferase in complex with {tRNA.} We also present ternary complexes of this enzyme with both {RNA} duplex mimics of the {tRNA} acceptor stem that terminate with the nucleotides C74 or C75, as well as the appropriate incoming nucleoside 5'-triphosphates. A single nucleotide-binding pocket exists whose specificity for both {CTP} and {ATP} is determined by the protein side chain of Arg 224 and backbone phosphates of the {tRNA,} which are non-complementary to and thus exclude {UTP} and {GTP.} Discrimination between {CTP} or {ATP} at a given addition step and at termination arises from changes in the size and shape of the nucleotide binding site that is progressively altered by the elongating 3' end of the {tRNA.}},

	abstract = {We report here a comparative analysis of the genome sequence of Methanosarcina barkeri with those of Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina mazei. The genome of M. barkeri is distinguished by having an organization that is well conserved with respect to the other Methanosarcina spp. in the region proximal to the origin of replication, with interspecies gene similarities as high as 95\%. However, it is disordered and marked by increased transposase frequency and decreased gene synteny and gene density in the distal semigenome. Of the 3,680 open reading frames {(ORFs)} in M. barkeri, 746 had homologs with better than 80\% identity to both M. acetivorans and M. mazei, while 128 nonhypothetical {ORFs} were unique (nonorthologous) among these species, including a complete formate dehydrogenase operon, genes required for N-acetylmuramic acid synthesis, a 14-gene gas vesicle cluster, and a bacterial-like P450-specific ferredoxin reductase cluster not previously observed or characterized for this genus. A cryptic 36-kbp plasmid sequence that contains an orc1 gene flanked by a presumptive origin of replication consisting of 38 tandem repeats of a 143-nucleotide motif was detected in M. barkeri. Three-way comparison of these genomes reveals differing mechanisms for the accrual of changes. Elongation of the relatively large M. acetivorans genome is the result of uniformly distributed multiple gene scale insertions and duplications, while the M. barkeri genome is characterized by localized inversions associated with the loss of gene content. In contrast, the short M. mazei genome most closely approximates the putative ancestral organizational state of these species.},

	abstract = {A detailed analysis of the polbeta superfamily of nucleotidyltransferases was performed using computer methods for iterative database search, multiple alignment, motif analysis and structural modeling. Three previously uncharacterized families of predicted nucleotidyltransferases are described. One of these new families includes small proteins found in all archaea and some bacteria that appear to consist of the minimal nucleotidyltransferase domain and may resemble the ancestral state of this superfamily. Another new family that is specifically related to eukaryotic {polyA} polymerases is typified by yeast Trf4p and Trf5p proteins that are involved in chromatin remodeling. The {TRF} family is represented by multiple members in all eukaryotes and may be involved in yet unknown nucleotide polymerization reactions required for maintenance of chromatin structure. Another new family of bacterial and archaeal nucleotidyltransferases is predicted to function in signal transduction since, in addition to the nucleotidyltransferase domain, these proteins contain ligand-binding domains. It is further shown that the catalytic domain of gamma proteobacterial adenylyl cyclases is homologous to the polbeta superfamily nucleotidyltransferases which emphasizes the general trend for the origin of signal-transducing enzymes from those involved in replication, repair and {RNA} processing. Classification of the polbeta superfamily into distinct families and examination of their phyletic distribution suggests that the evolution of this type of nucleotidyltransferases may have included bursts of rapid divergence linked to the emergence of new functions as well as a number of horizontal gene transfer events.},
